# Assessing Grassland Ecosystem Resilience to Climate Extremes Using Remote Sensing üåçüåæ

## What's this project about?
In this honours project, you'll investigate how grassland ecosystems around the world respond to extreme climate events (like droughts and heatwaves) using satellite imagery and a systematic review of existing literature. You'll explore ecological resilience, quantify impacts, and draw global conclusions.

**Original Keywords:** Ecology, Animal behaviour, Evolution, Conservation biology, Climate change, Computational modelling, Systematic review, Data analysis

## What will you do?

- Identify and process publicly available remote sensing data (e.g., MODIS, Sentinel, NDVI) to quantify changes in grassland productivity after extreme climate events.
- Conduct statistical analyses (like change-point detection, regression, resilience indices) to measure ecological resilience.
- Perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing studies on grassland responses to climate extremes.
- Integrate your analyses to synthesize global patterns of grassland resilience, suggesting potential adaptive management strategies.

## Finding Data

You'll independently search for and select suitable satellite datasets and published studies. Good starting points include Google Earth Engine, NASA, NOAA datasets, and databases like Web of Science or Google Scholar for systematic reviews. I'm available to guide your choices!

## What I expect from you

This project should reflect your personal research interests and ambitions. It is designed to be:

- **Student-led**: You take charge of the direction, research questions, and overall progress of the project.
- **Independent**: You‚Äôre expected to develop your own analytical methods, solve problems, and conduct research autonomously.
- **Flexible**: Feel free to adapt and modify your project focus or methodologies as you uncover new insights or data.

## How I'll help

As your supervisor, my role is as a critical guide and advisor:

- I'll provide guidance on remote sensing data analysis, computational modelling, systematic review methods, and statistical analysis (Python, R, GIS tools).
- I won't conduct analyses or programming tasks directly for you.
- I'm not an ecologist or biologist, but I have a strong interest in these fields. You'll need to independently engage with biological and ecological literature for relevant context and interpretations.

## What skills will you gain?

- Proficiency in remote sensing analysis and GIS tools
- Statistical analysis and computational modelling skills (Python/R)
- Experience conducting systematic reviews and meta-analysis
- Enhanced independent research, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities

## How to start?

1. Identify suitable datasets and define clear initial research questions.
2. Draft a short proposal outlining your intended methodologies and analyses.
3. Discuss your ideas with me to refine your project plan.

I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing your project unfold. Don't hesitate to reach out for advice or guidance along the way!
